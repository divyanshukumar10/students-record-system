# students-record-system

The mini-project “Student Record System Project in C” is a console application using the C programming language. This project compiled in Code Blocks with the GCC compiler. In this console application, you can do basic Student Record tasks like adding the student info, view the added student, search the students, ..etc.<br><br>
This application based on file handling in C, where I have used a file-related function like fopen, fread, fwrite, ..etc. Good thing is that “Student Record System Project” is password-protected, so only authorized persons able to login to this application.<br><br>

Also to increase the readability, I have broken the application in different functions. Each function of the project extensively use in the file handing function, so it is also a great project to understand file handling in C.<br><br>
